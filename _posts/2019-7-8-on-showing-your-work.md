This is a paragraph, it's surrounded by whitespace. Next up are some headers, they're heavily influenced by GitHub's markdown style.

##Evaluating Markdown, documenting your work and other dev stories

### Evaluating Markdown

After trying various platforms for documenting work, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) appealed the most of the bunch. Their ease of use, especially the static site generation, SSG, was a strong deciding factor for taking deep dives into the mechanics of how these platforms work. The fact that you could template therein was also a clincher! 

![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jekyll-logo.png "an image title")

* A bulletted list
- alternative syntax 1
+ alternative syntax 2
  - an indented list item

1. An
2. ordered
3. list

Inline markup styles:

- _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()`

> Blockquote
>> Nested Blockquote

Syntax highlighting can be used with triple backticks, like so:

```javascript
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```

Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  

Finally, horizontal lines
